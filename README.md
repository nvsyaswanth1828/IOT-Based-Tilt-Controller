# IOT-Based-Tilt-Controller
This project demonstrates a tilt-controlled IoT system built using Raspberry Pi Pico W and MicroPython as a college IoT mini project.

Overview
The system detects tilt using a sensor and performs actions such as controlling the navigation (arrow) keys of a laptop keyboard based on the direction of tilt.

Using this mechanism, the project can be used to control racing or gesture-based games on a laptop. It showcases sensor interfacing, wireless data transfer, and control logic using MicroPython and Python.

Hardware Used
Raspberry Pi Pico W
Tilt Sensor / MPU6050
Breadboard
Jumper Wires
Power Supply
Software & Tools
MicroPython
Python
Thonny IDE
VS Code
Working
The tilt sensor detects changes in orientation.
Raspberry Pi Pico W reads the sensor data using MicroPython.
The tilt values are sent to a web interface hosted by the Pico W.
A Python program running on the laptop reads the tilt data.
Based on the received values, the laptop’s arrow keys are controlled, enabling gesture-based navigation or gaming control.
Applications
Gesture-controlled devices
Gesture-based gaming controllers
Robotics control
Smart embedded systems
Academic Context
Developed as part of a college IoT mini project.

Code Structure
pico_w/main.py – MicroPython code running on Raspberry Pi Pico W. Reads tilt sensor data and hosts a web interface.
laptop/receiver.py – Python program running on the laptop to receive tilt data and control keyboard arrow keys.
